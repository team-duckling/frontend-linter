**NAMING CONVENTIONS**

By following the naming convention, the purpose and meaning of these

variables are clear, making the code more readable and maintainable.

1. Components

Use **PascalCase** (capitalizing the first letter of each word) for component names.

2. Files

Name your files using **PascalCase**, matching the component name. For example, if you have a component named UserCard, the file should be named UserCard.js.
